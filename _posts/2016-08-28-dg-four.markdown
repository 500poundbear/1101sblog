### Plan for the class
- Recursion
  - Recap of how to solve things recursively
  - Tower of Hanoi
  - Coin Change

- What does Higher Order Programming actually mean
  - Passing functions to functions
  - Returning functions from functions
  - Invariants can help to **reason about correctness**
  - Go through DG materials slowly
  - Reiterate on *substitution model*

I think I'm going to cover more on higher order functions and focus on the intuition when solving such problems. 

Change of DG venue from now on. 

#### Lesson Flow
- Review slides for 3A
- Go through DG questions on recursion
- Review slides for 3B
- Go through remaining DG questions
- Focus on higher order functions and questions

Week four bring it on!

#### Updates on robomission testing

Fish, Anna and Ben helped me with the robots. But I haven't installed lejos yet, must less try out the interpreter. Will start tonight.
