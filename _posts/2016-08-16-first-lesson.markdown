### Reflections

The class was not too dead. I hope to mix people up for the next few DGs by allocating where they are supposed to seat. In hopes that they will share and discuss their solutions with the others.

I ended very early though, the class was dismissed by the 1:20 hr mark. I went through the textbook with them, highlighting concepts that they had to know well in order to progress properly in this course.

According to De Shun, I used all the keywords correctly. Yay. I hope I explained the concepts properly, in a way that could be understood.

I was asked questions related to the substitution model after the class ended. I briefly explained to them that at this point in time, take it as you Ctrl-F your way through the function with each var declaration. 

I had to explain for why source isn't working the way that they are expecting, and for those with programming background, it was a little different from what they were used to.

I think I'll put more emphasis on this the next week, so that they would not be as confused as I was last year when I was wondering why the substitution model was taught at all.
