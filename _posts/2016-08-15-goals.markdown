### Goals
These are the goals that I want to achieve for my tutorial group.

- For everyone to know each other
- Peer support: a small community of learners where they can ask each other questions without being judged (the questions must be reasonable of couse)
- For everyone to get better at learning how to learn.


### Expectations of every student
- Homework must be attempted before the lesson. The definition of attempted, means that the homework is completed or close to completion
- All to attend every DG
- To ask. If I can't answer I will find the answer. 

### My Plans
- To complete every DG and revise on the old concepts by the end of week 2.
- Settle the robotics missions and the setting up of the java transpiler. 
- Document each week's lesson plan and thoughts about teaching here.

### Lesson plan
- Revision on what was covered*
- Go through tutorial content*
- Looking at the textbook together
- Scrolling through the forum together


I'm thankful for the opportunity to be entrusted with students to teach, and I will try my best to teach them in my fullest capacity.
