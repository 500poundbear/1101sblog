### Review

So I covered everything that I was supposed to cover. Except my plan to go through the textbook. Which we ran out of time. 

I didn't expect that more than half the class couldn't do the second part of DG3 on order of growth. I hope I facilitated their understanding of the order of growth.

I think I could have explained the reason for a lower bound, upper bound and tight bound better. Perhaps by starting with a graphical explanation, of the purpose of each type of bound, the students would be able to grasp this order of growth concept better.
