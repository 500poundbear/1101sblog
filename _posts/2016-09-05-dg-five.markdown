### Plan for the class
Drawing lists are important, so everyone will get a chance to attempt a question on the board. 

Ask everyone to write the solution to taking every alternate number in the list on the board.

Discuss the order of growth of lists (when is it theta n and when is it theta 1, usually)

#### Lesson Flow
- Review slides for 4A (Focus on pair and why the first portion of the slides discuss how to use a function to create an abstraction for **make_pair**
- Go through DG questions on lists
- Review slides for 4B
- Go through burning DG questions

#### Updates on robomission testing

Will start tomorrow. This comes with porting the mission to markdown
