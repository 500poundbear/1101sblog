### Plan for the class

Functional programming concepts: filter and accumulate. The aim of this lesson will be to provide as much **intuition** as possible, and to emphasise on the tricky parts of accumulation and filtering. Ensuring that everyone can come up with a solution to the problem, as well as modifications to the problem.

I'll cover usual tricks that can be used to solve such problems, as well as possible practise questions so that the students will be proficient. 

It's easy to get overwhelmed, especially when the functions start to nest together. (pun narrowly averted). I think I'll just go through everything on paper for this lesson.

I feel like a tuition teacher when I say something like "Sure come out one" lol.

Wew week 6 already.

#### Updates on robomission testing

NodeJS works. Was super elated because I spent so many nights trying to get the firmware to work! I'm not sure whether there is time to come up with new missions (deadline's pretty tight) but with Mingyu helping me maybe we can do more.

Gah got to flash all the memory cards :(
